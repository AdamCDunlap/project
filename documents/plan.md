# Project plan

## Language evaluation

I will know that the language is good if writing a simple state machine for a
robot is very easy and takes very little code. As a metric, writing picobot in
C++ should be only a few lines of code.

## Implementation plan
Since I'm doing an internal DSL in C++, I don't have to worry about a parser,
just the semantics. Thus, almost all of my implementation work will be there,
and probably in C++.
